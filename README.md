# Algo-Trading

The above programs are the implementations of the technical indicators Commodity channel index, exponential moving average and parabolic stop and reverse and there combinations which works for all the stocks and produces the outputs of their corresponding graphs.

These python programs are back tested many times with different stocks.

These are implemented using python,numpy,pandas for data processing and for 2 dimensional multiplications and matplotlib for plotting the graph with (Time vs Close prices) or (Time vs Technical indicator resulting values)

I have also added Technical Analysis module by Zerodha  which will be useful for detailed understanding.
